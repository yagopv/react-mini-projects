# React mini projects

This repo shows examples of code for React

## Install all dependencies

This is a lerna monorepo using yarn workspaces so common dependencies are going to live in the root folder

```
yarn bootstrap
```

## Execute each project

Look at the scripts in `package.json`

```
yarn {project}
```
